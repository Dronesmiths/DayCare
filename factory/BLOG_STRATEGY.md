# AI Pilots: Blog & Cornerstone Content Strategy

To dominate local search, the site must move beyond "Service Pages" and establish **Intent Ownership** through cornerstone pillars and project-driven blogs.

## 1. The Cornerstone Pillars (The "God" Articles)
Identify 3-5 massive guides that establish the brand as THE authority in the niche/location.
- **Example**: "The Essential Guide to Choosing the Right Child Care in Palmdale"
- **Example**: "How to Prepare Your Child for Their First Day of Daycare"
- **Goal**: 2,000+ words, internal links to EVERY service page, and external links to local community resources.

## 2. Activity Spotlights (Case Studies)
For every major activity or improvement, create a "Proof of Care" post.
- **Components**:
    - **The Goal**: (e.g., "Designing a new sensory garden for outdoor play")
    - **The Result**: "Happy children exploring our new backyard playground"
    - **The Visuals**: (Happy children, colorful playground, swings)
    - **The Locality**: Mention city landmarks or specific neighborhood names in Palmdale.

## 3. PAA Cluster Posts (Search Volume Capture)
Use the "People Also Ask" questions from [SEO_ROADMAP.md](SEO_ROADMAP.md) to create short-form (500-800 word) value posts.
- **Topic**: "How much does daycare cost in Palmdale, CA?"
- **Topic**: "What are the benefits of residential childcare for toddlers?"
